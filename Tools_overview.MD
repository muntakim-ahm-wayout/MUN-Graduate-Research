## Tools for graduate research work
The graduate studies requires lots of extra tools to successfully complete different projects. Here are the list of my faverite tools. These list will grow as i get the chance to write more about other tools that i used. 

## Steps to learn these tool
In the following sections, i will give a brief overview of the tools and detailed descussion are provided in folders.

### Code management
To work as a team to develop various programs and code, i use [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/).

### Programming Language

* In my day to day analysis, i normally use Python 3.X. But when i need to model in ABAQUS i use python 2.7. 
* When i need to write subroutine for ABAQUS, I use FORTRAN and C++
* I used MATLAB for acoustic leak noise characterization

### Software 

* [ABAQUS](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/abaqus/) used for Finite element analysis and Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL). 
* [LabView](http://www.ni.com/en-ca/shop/labview.html?cid=Paid_Search-129008-US_Canada-Google_ESW1_LabVIEW_Broad&s_kwcid=AL!6304!3!277358336523!b!!g!!%2Blabview&gclid=Cj0KCQjw19DlBRCSARIsAOnfReiTznPVrliulcXmUspVofYA-Hm9p-qRSGfqhhz1ERTzRoVUUpOq4aYaAujCEALw_wcB) for data aquisition in our laboratory

### Reference manager:
To keep track of the research papers i read and will use as reference, i normally use [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com). It is a very efficient for managing references and articles.
