# Welcome to introduction to essential research tools

## Who needs these instructions:
These document is written explicitly for those who wants to join the research group of [Dr. Dhar](https://www.mun.ca/engineering/about/people/ashutoshsutradhar.php). We developed some extraordinay computational methodologies and programs. These documents will guide future students to be well prepared for graduate studies. 

## How to use these documents
These documents have couple of folders (i.e. Part_0, Part_1 ...etc). In each folder there are specific instruction at the starting page of the folder (README.MD).

Please follow [this link](Tools_overview.MD) for overview of the tools that we use frequently.

## I will develop the full content of this document gradually. The final document will teach you all the components (Python, git, ABAQUS, C++ and Fortran).

## But currently this document will not teach you how to do things rather it will guide you to that direction from where you can learn things and solve by yourself.


# This document is still under development. Please check frquently if new information is available.
